# Airline-Management-System
This is a Java-based airline boarding pass interface developed using Swing. It takes a PNR number as input and displays passenger details including name, nationality, source, destination, flight name, flight code, and date. The layout is designed to show key information in a clean, side-by-side format, mimicking a real-world airline ticket.
